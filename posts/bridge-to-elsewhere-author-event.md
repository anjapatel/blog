I have a new story coming out in a spaceship-themed anthology called "Bridge to Elsewhere", pending funding via Kickstarter! Alana Joli Abbott and Julia Rios edited it and stacked the table of contents with some incredible talent. It's an honor to share such company, and Alana and Julia are wonderful editors.

I will be doing a reading alongside some of the other authors to promote the Kickstarter this Friday (11/19) at 8 PM EST. The tickets can be purchased on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/203975735917). If you want to support the Kickstarter so this sparkly indie anthology can exist in the world, you can do so [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330509990/bridge-to-elsewhere-anthology?utm_content=buffer595d5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

I definitely owe some updates since the last time I wrote. I have been up to shenanigans ranging from driving out to New Mexico with my dog to publishing a few new stories that I'm excited to talk about. I have a newsletter draft in my Google Drive just waiting for me to hit send. Hopefully I can get it out before getting lost in the upcoming holiday vortex!

Hope y'all are well!
