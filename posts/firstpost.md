Yes! I am trying to get this off the ground again!

I’ve mentioned it before, but the thing that always gets in the way of me committing to any type of blog/newsletter/etc. is knowing when to declare a post finished. When left to my own devices, I tinker endlessly. So I am imposing restrictions on myself:
<!-- excerpt -->

* Posts will not exceed 750 words.
* I will not sped more than 2 hours writing.

I have already broken both rules. Now! For the sake of economy, some rapid-fire questions.


**Why are you resurrecting your blog now?**

I deactivated my social media accounts a couple months ago, and in lieu of that I want to maintain some type of digital footprint. Hopefully this can be a nice way to stay in touch with people (I’m sorry that I chose such a one-sided medium).

**What will it be about?**

What I’m reading and writing and some life updates.

**Writing! Are you going back to writing full time?**

No. I’m lucky to have found a fulfilling career and I’m not looking to leave that any time soon. Rather, I love to write and I’m finally getting to the point where I’m more comfortable with the vulnerability it demands. I’m in a couple of writing groups and getting ready to (finally) submit work to markets.

**What type of writing do you do now?**

Fiction, though I'm open to getting back to writing book & pop culture reviews on the side. More specifically: science fiction/fantasy/horror and all the things in between. I have a soft spot for folklore and bending the laws of physics, so make of that what you will. Right now, I’m focusing on short fiction to hone my chops a bit before I tackle longer work.

**Wait, you deactivated social media?**

Technically my Facebook is still up, though I haven't used it since 2016 or 2017. But yes, I my deactived Instagram and Twitter, which to me feels the same as going vegan.

**...Why?**

Because you all stress me out. Sigh I’m being flippant. This answer need its own post. Some day.

**Is this a blog or a newsletter?**

Both! I’m publishing to my site (anjali.fyi)[anjali.fyi] and cross-posting to (substack)[https://anjalipatel.substack.com/] for the newsletter portion. I had planned to bundle everything together and aggregate the content directly from my site to people’s inboxes, but, uh, I broke some things at the last minute. Rather than endlessly tinker with it cough I am moving forward with what I can and will figure the rest out at some point.

**What do you do with your free time now that you’re off social?**

I refresh my email. I pet my dog. I text someone back. At least I think — it’s hard to say. Nothing concrete has crashed in to fill the void. It doesn’t feel like it’s added any hours to my day, and I don’t feel more productive or available. It’s more like I’ve taken a piece of furniture from the room, and only now after it’s gone do I realize how much clutter it had added before. For me, this works.

**How is Romeo?**

Good, good. He just cuddled too hard with his blanket and shocked himself with static and now looks very perplexed.

## And here’s what I’ve been reading:

**The Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka (novella)**

I thought this was brilliant! Sorry to anyone who hated it in high school! I’m sure I would have, too! I closed the book days ago and I still keep getting hit by waves of claustrophobia and despair. I know I should focus more on the commentary on capitalism & labor, but the degree to which we get inside Gregor’s head — thought by thought, minute by minute — and his excruciating devolvement into all-consuming anguish was so damn haunting and effective. It felt like a master class on head-hopping and point of view. Just...agh. And why couldn’t his family just talk to him? I’m sads.

**A Land of Blood and Snow, by Cooper Anderson (short story)**

Rubs palms together. Gorgeous prose and grim, fantastical worlds hit a sweet spot for me. Highly recommend if that’s your jam, too. Read it here.

**1919, by Eve L. Ewing (poetry anthology)**

A collection of poems inspired by the Chicago race riots of 1919. Longreads says, “Every poem leaves a bruise," and I think that is a perfect summation.

The collection heavily references “The Negro In Chicago: A Study On Race Relations And A Race Riot,” a sociological study composed by a council of six black men and six white men after the riots. You can read all 800+ pages (!!!) [here](http://moses.law.umn.edu/darrow/documents/The_Negro_in_Chicago_1922.pdf). One of the poems — “[Countless Schemes](https://therumpus.net/2018/06/rumpus-original-poetry-three-poems-by-eve-l-ewing/),” a response to proposed solutions to the “Negro problem” referenced in the report — still hurts to think about.

## And a snippet from my writing compost bin:

> “The sky was a grey, featureless blanket: too stagnant to promise rain or snow, but viscous enough to dampen sound and cast the world in tepid shadow. Everything felt a little duller, a little...less.”

Until next time!
