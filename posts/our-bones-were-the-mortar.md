The first thing I do after I wake up is walk Romeo, and then I come home and write. Sometimes as we walk, I imagine myself moving through the story I’m focused on from the main character’s point of view. I ask myself: What are they seeing, smelling, hearing? What are they feeling? 

<!-- excerpt -->

I had a [story come out](https://twitter.com/anjapatel/status/1396582852792307712?s=20) last week in [khōréō](https://www.khoreomag.com/) magazine. Everyone who gave me feedback on this story — from my most trusted crit partners to its editor, the wonderful and empathetic [Ola Hill](https://twitter.com/_aleksandrahill) — handled it with such attentiveness and care. And despite the support I had in writing it, walking through this story first thing in the morning always, without fail, ruined my day.

_**Spoilers from this point onward**_

I don’t remember when or how I learned that the Financial District sits on top of an African burial ground, but through writing “Our Bones Were The Mortar” I’ve learned this: There are upwards of [15,000](https://www.nps.gov/afbg/learn/historyculture/index.htm) bodies interred beneath lower Manhattan in the largest African gravesite in North America. Some of the bodies were buried with West African jewelry such as [glass shells and cowrie waist beads](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~arihuang/academic/abg/artifacts/culturalartifacts.html), indicating that they were likely first-generation enslaved. Of the graves that were excavated, nearly half [belonged to children](https://www.nps.gov/afbg/learn/historyculture/african-burial-ground-in-history.htm). And we only know any of this because in 1991, the [burial ground was discovered](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/arts/design/26burial.html) when construction began on a new office tower.

There is an [African Burial Ground National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/afbg/index.htm). I have only seen it in pictures, and would have made more of an effort to view it, touch it, breathe it in had I started this piece in pre-pandemic times. I want to make this very clear: I am glad this monument exists. I appreciate the effort that went into getting it erected. 

A single monument is a paltry acknowledgment.

My ancestors formed the foundation of this country’s wealth by the labor they were forced to provide. Now they form the bedrock of this country — arguably, the world’s — financial capital with their very bones. When I commuted to the Financial District knowing this, each step felt like a knife to the spirit. People rushed by at that signature self-possessed New York City clip and I could not help but think: How can you not feel this? How do you not care? How are you not absolutely gutted?

And that has become a refrain these past few years, as Black pain and Black death pull me deeper and deeper underwater. All too often, someone or something pushes me in a little farther  and I am left thinking once again: How can you not feel this? How do you not care? How are you not absolutely gutted?

I don’t know if this story does what I’ve felt these past few years any justice. I worry that I should have waited, that I should have been a much better writer before tackling something with so much weight. But the question kept rattling and demanded to be let out: What would it take for this country to atone?

This is my answer.

“Our Bones Were The Mortar” is available in the [second issue of khōréō](https://www.khoreomag.com/product/volume-1-issue-2/), an online speculative fiction magazine centering immigrant and diaspora authors.
