Short and sweet update with some cute news! The BBC Symphony Orchestra will be doing a live reading of “Our Bones Are the Mortar” for their Ghost Stories and Music for Christmas concert at the Barbican Center.

<!-- excerpt -->

Ghost stories by me, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, Saki, and Tony Walker will be read on stage to live music. If you’ve [read my story](https://www.khoreomag.com/fiction/our-bones-were-the-mortar/), you know it has zero things to do with Christmas, but I am honored the BBC reached out to me nonetheless.

If you are in London and would like to attend, book your tickets [here](https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2025/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-ghost-stories-at-christmas)! It will be broadcast on [BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002nyqb) on December 27 at 8:45 AM EST, and BBC Radio 3 sometime in 2026.

I am curious (and a bit squirmy) to experience someone else reading my work, particularly on the other side of the pond, when this story is (literally) rooted in the bedrock of New York City. Makes me curious about the ghosts I will meet in London’s dark corners this week.

Anyway. Hauntings aside, I’m excited for some holiday market time (and to finally eat at [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/))!

Cheers!
