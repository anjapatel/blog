Anjali is a Black and South Asian speculative fiction writer. She writes to explore agency, ancestral severance, convoluted mythologies of her own devising, and the stars.

At different times in her life, Anjali has been a piano teacher, video editor, dog handler, and waitress on dude ranch. For several years, she was paid to author hundreds of [viral internet personality quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anjalipatel). Now she's a software engineer.

Her work can be found in Uncanny Magazine, Fantasy Magazine, Escape Pod, khōréō, BuzzFeed, Teen Vogue, and others. She is based in Brooklyn where she lives with a grizzled dog who offered to teach her magic in exchange for free rent. Find her on Twitter at [@anjapatel](https://twitter.com/anjapatel).
