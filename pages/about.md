Anjali is a Black and South Asian speculative fiction writer. She writes to explore agency, ancestral severance, convoluted mythologies of her own devising, and the stars.

Her work can be found in Uncanny Magazine, Fantasy Magazine, Escape Pod, khōréō, BuzzFeed, Teen Vogue, and others. In 2025, she was a recipient of the [Writing Excuses Retreat Scholarship](https://writingexcuses.com/scholarships/) and admitted to [Tin House Autumn Online](https://tinhouse.com/workshop/autumn-online/). Sometime in the early 2000s, she won [first place](https://www.neopets.com/contributions_poems.phtml/contributions_poems.phtml?place=524) in a Neopets poetry competition.

At different times in her life, Anjali has been a piano teacher, video editor, dog handler, and waitress on dude ranch. For several years, she was paid to author hundreds of [viral internet personality quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anjalipatel). Now she's a software engineer.

She is based in New York City, but you can (sometimes) find her online at [@anjapatel](https://twitter.com/anjapatel) everywhere.
