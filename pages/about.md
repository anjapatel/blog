Anjali is a Black and South Asian speculative fiction writer. She writes to explore queerness, agency, ancestral severance, convoluted mythologies of her own devising, and the stars.

At different times in her life, Anjali has been a piano teacher, video editor, dog handler, and waitress on dude ranch. For several years, she was paid to author hundreds of [viral personality quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anjalipatel) for the internet. Now, she's opted for a much more conventional career as a computer whisperer and very much enjoys it.

Her work can be found in BuzzFeed, Teen Vogue, Bustle, and forthcoming in Flash Fiction Online. She is based in Brooklyn where she lives with a grizzled dog who offered to teach her magic in exchange for free rent. Find her on Twitter at [@anjapatel](https://twitter.com/anjapatel).
